    "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TriviaCrack/\">Trivia Crack</a> is a very popular mobile quiz game developed by Etermax. It's a competitive trivia game where the user can challenge other players on a variety of interesting topics answering multiple-choice questions. Check out this short trailer:</p>\n",

    "<p>As players progress through the game, they will win gold coins when they beat their rival. This type of currency that is generally earned by playing or just waiting is called soft currency and can be spent for in-game benefits like lives, power-ups and gems. These currencies can be used to separate some content for paying and non-paying players or it can be used to have a better understanding of the game economy and detect opportunities to maximize revenue. For example, by having special offers in some weeks of the year that might be more profitable.\n",
